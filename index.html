            <h4>How to Travel without Your Dog</h4>
            <p>There are many websites full of helpful information about how to travel with your dog. We can take our dog, Dino, on car trips, but on a month long trip to Southeast Asia that included a 40 hour air travel marathon, a 13 night cruise, and three months living in Honolulu, it just didn't seem possible. As a 27 pound cockapoo, Dino isn't a dog who "fits under the seat in front of you", so even assuming everything else could be arranged, I couldn't see putting him crated in an airplane cargo hold for 16 hour trans-Pacific flights or in the holds of planes run by airlines in countries where they eat dogs.</p>

            <p>Some of my dog loving friends just won't make a trip unless they can bring their dog. I totally understand how they feel. Missing Dino has had me fawning over other people's dogs in elevators, on the street and in parks all over the world. I can pantomime "May I pet your dog?" in many languages...<a href="#" class="readArticle">(more)</a>
            <div class="readMoreArticle"></p>

              <p>Some might consider me selfish, but I want to have a dog to love and care for and I want to indulge my wanderlust. For those who find themselves in similar circumstances, here's how to travel without your dog:</p>

              <ol>
              <li>Make sure your dog is socialized with other people and with other dogs. If your dog loves only you, traveling without him/her is going to be a terrible strain on both of you. If your dog is great with people, but not so good with other dogs, this will limit your options, but they still exist.</li>

              <li><p>Have someone stay in your home with your dog while you're away. If you know people with dogs (and it's hard not to if you take your dog for walks in your neighborhood), chances are they can recommend someone they hire to stay at their home and care for their dog when they're away. This is the optimal arrangement if your dog is most happy at home and doesn't get along with other dogs. However, it is also the most expensive option. There are also websites where you can be matched up with people looking to house sit who are animal lovers also willing to pet sit. Participants on both sides of these arrangements have usually been vetted (pun most definitely intended) and this can be a win-win financially for everyone.
              Have your dog stay with someone who boards dogs at their home. </p>
              <p>Before we knew someone with whom to trade dog sitting, this is the option we used. Through another dog owner, we found a dog loving couple with a stay at home wife who took a few dogs at a time into their home. They had a big fenced in back yard and Dino was treated like a family member. This was not an inexpensive option, but I'd rather stay in a less fancy hotel on a trip and spend the money to know our dog was well taken care of and content.
              Board your dog at a kennel or "doggie hotel". This wouldn't be my first choice because boarded dogs aren't living in a very homey situation -- although some higher end boarding facilities have fancy dog beds in little pet apartments that might even include a television.</p>
              <p>Usually, you pay additional fees for extra walks, play time with other dogs or extra time with a caretaker. If you board your dog at a facility where they will be exposed to other dogs, a rabies certificate and a bortadella vaccine for "kennel cough" are vital and probably required. If your dog goes to a doggie day care, they usually also offer boarding services and this is probably the arrangement that would give you the most peace of mind because you know the staff and your dog is familiar with them and the surroundings.</p><br>
              Totally luck out like we did and have dog loving relatives who also have a dog and who are willing to take care of and love your dog for four months while you're away!
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you find the right situation for your dog, you will still miss them, but you'll know they're happy and well cared for while you're away.<a href="#" class="readArticle">(less)</a>

            <h4>Should dogs hike off-leash at all? Readers debate leashing dogs on trails</h4>
            <p>The topic of hiking with off-leash dogs generated a lot of discussion on Facebook last weekend, after nature photographer Gary David Currie posted a video of his pup walking free, and dangerously close to the edge of a cliff.</p>

            <p>It also generated some good conversation on Oregonlive Thursday, in the comments of my story exploring the dangers of off-leash hiking and the laws in place to keep dogs and humans safe on precipitous trails. Here are the highlight of a pretty good conversation (some comments edited for length)...<a href="#" class="readMoreHike">(more)</a>
            <div class="readMoreHikes"></p>

            <p>The predominant viewpoint, at least at the beginning, was one of reasonable caution:</p>

            Should people hike with their dogs off-leash?<br>
            Yes! Dogs should run free!<br>
            No. Leash them up.<br>
            It depends on the trail.<br>
            <p>VoteView Results</p>

            <strong>kommon sense</strong>

            <p>Leash requirements need to reflect the situation at that location.  In city parks, dogs should be on a leash unless in a designated off leash area. Out in nature outside the city and urban areas, the issues change and usually having your dog leashed is as much about keeping the dog safe as anything else. </p>

            <strong>Nonseq8tur</strong>

            <p>It's a judgment call.  I took my dog for her first backcountry trip, circled the South Sister and climbed to the top to spend the night.  I used a leash where it was required in areas of higher use--sometimes letting her drag it so I could grab it quickly. She is a two-year-old 30lb high-energy dog.</p>
            hamsy

            <p>Clearly this is an issue that must be evaluated on a case by case basis. Owners need to be honest about how well they control their dogs both on and off leash (some dogs are a danger ON leash) and evaluate each trail. For every hazardous trail there must be dozens of much more dog friendly trails ... A blanket "no dogs off leash" policy is ridiculous.<p>

            <p>Though some commenters promised to take much more extreme action if an unleashed dog came bounding up the trail:</p>

            <strong>WeWontDial911</strong>

            <p>Sure it's safe to hike with your dog off leash if you don't mind my shooting it if it attacks me. When I hike, I usually do carry my firearm as I have had some run ins with wild life, mainly bears and mountain lions. Thankfully, I have not had to shoot them, but wouldn't hesitate if I needed to.</p>

            <strong>Johnny Cage</strong>

            <p>Someone had their dog off leash on the Pacific Crest Trail near Odell Lake a few years ago ... The dog came charging at me and the owner was nowhere to be seen. I always carry a pistol with me while hiking/backpacking and drew down on the dog. The owner is lucky the dog stopped charging at about 30 feet away.</p>

            <p>A few readers shared their own stories about hiking with their dogs, which had a tendency to get painful, even downright tragic:</p>

            Suz066:<br>
            <p>I owned and adored my two goldens and had one of them gone over a cliff, heartbroken doesn't even come close to the despair I would feel.  If you can't protect your furry friend the same way you would your child, you shouldn't have a pet. </p>

            beervendor:<br>
            <p>I used to let my dogs walk off leash in the woods then one day one of them yelped in pain and emerged from the brush with a mouthful of porcupine quills. From then on I've kept them on leash for that reason and several others.</p>

            4Portlandia:<br>
             <p>...While backpacking with my Golden Retriever in Goat Rocks on a remote trail, he took off after a marmot in an open meadow. He got into predator instinct and would not stop - and this was a dog that listened to me. Luckily, the marmot disappeared and my dog pooped out. But, I had to run after him for about 1/4 mile to catch him.</p>

            <p>And, perhaps inevitably, the debate tpivoted suddenly to the issue of poop:</p>

            beautifulportland:<br>
            <p>Forget the leash, let's address dog poop left on many Oregon trails that other hikers have to deal with.<a href="#" class="readMoreHike">(less)</a>
