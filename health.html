              <p>Viruses – Canine flu has many strains like H3N2 and H3N8.  The canine influenza virus (CIV) is most often passed in dog parks, doggie daycares, kennels, animal shelters and grooming or veterinary facilities.  Other possible places that viruses can be shed are boarding facilities, pet stores and competitions.  This means that the chances your dog can get infected is in close contact with other dogs and not outdoors or in casual contact.</p>

              <p>Vaccines – You might think that canine flu vaccines will keep your dog from the flu however dog vaccines, like human vaccines don’t prevent infection.  The best strategy for your dog’s overall health is a nutritionally balanced diet as well as avoidance of places where large groups of dogs are together like doggie daycare, especially when you hear about outbreaks of dog flu.</p>
              <p>Duration – After your dog has been infected with dog flu you may see symptoms in 2 to 3 days.
