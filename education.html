          <h3>This Week in Education/Training</h3>
          <div class="newsArticle">
            <h4>Not training a puppy affects more than just the dog</h4>
            <p>Not training a new puppy doesn’t only affect the puppy, but family members and local shelters as well. According to Cathy McDaniel, executive director at the Panhandle Humane Society, people relinquish their dogs because they are not house-trained and dirty up their homes. She says crate training a puppy is extremely important to avoiding this problem.</p>

            <p>“Often times what happens is people get puppies and they’re so cute, they’re sweet and they’re cuddly and they get all of this attention but they don’t get trained. Then six months down the road they’re unruly, they’re jumping and they’re barking and they wind up at the shelter because people can’t handle that anymore. You’re really doing a service for your dog and your family if you would take the time to train them properly,” said McDaniel. </p>

            <p>The Panhandle Humane Society will be holding behavioral classes in the spring, including how to clicker train dogs, call (308)-635-0922 for more information.

            <h4>What's the best training method for you?</h4>
            <p>Here you have it, you've brought home your new best friend except they don't know what you want from them. So, what method of training should you do? Ultimately, it will get down to what works for you and your dog and what doesn't. You can research and read boks as much as you want but not one particular book will have the right answer for you.</p>

            <p>Take for instance teething and biting. Some recommend letting out a high pitch yelp and walk away for 10 seconds once contact has been made with hands and teeth. This does not always work and you cannot be expected to "yelp" every single time your hand touches teeth otherwise you'll constantly be getting up and walking away for hours.</p>

            <p>Feel out what you and your pup do well with. Shelter dogs may take a lot more patience for correcting unwanted behavior because they didn't have someone to show them what the proper way was. Puppies are short attention spanners and can only stay focused for a certain amount of time. First timers should start out slow and short.</p>

            <p>Do your research and know what you're getting into before you start training. Begin with one goal and end with the success of that one goal and then build from there. Check out youtube videos where many users have walked through the training process so you can visually get a hang of what you need to do.</p>

          <h3>Tips for Tricks</h3>
          <div class="foodRecall">
            <ul>
            <li>Alternate between treats you use for training so your pooch won't get bored or doubt the incentive</li>
            <li>Young puppies are limited to access of public areas due to vaccines being specific times so be sure to do your research on facilities that allow puppies under 12Ibs to play. (Parvo can last up to a year on infected areas so be careful!)</li>
            <li>If you are a clicker advocate, make sure that each time you click you give a treat. So if you click multiple times to show you like what behavior your dog does, give them a treat for each click.</li>
            <li>Sometimes young puppies have their bad days. If they're too wild and having a temper tantrum, pick them up for 10 seconds and move them to another room or put them in their crate (calmly and gently) for ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Using the crate for disciple does work but you have to be gentle about it. You cannot angrily take your dog to the crate and shove them in there. You need to be calm, assertive, and direct them or set them in the crate for a time-out.</li>
